# MATLAB - Supply Chain Optimization

Provided support to a graduate student who was trying to implement her supply chain model to reduce carbon emissions by controlling the placement of distribution centres.

While the complexities of the math used were sometimes far too advanced for my understanding (Langragian relaxation and penalities method), I was still able to pick up a bare understanding of the methods based on my engineering background.

The techniques used are moreso a showcase of my ability to manipulate large and complicated arrays, and I'm sure if given more time (since the project was completed in less than 4 months due to strict deadlines), I would have a fuller understanding of the math behind it.

Until then, a link to the publication is provided below detailing the math behind the programming.
